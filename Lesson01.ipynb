    "First, a brief introduction. Python is currently the most used programming language worldwide. As you'll see it's quite simple to use, with easy syntax and semantics. The official website also provides extensive [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) for all things Python, how to use them and what exactly they do. Should you ever find yourself stuck on a Python problem, don't also be afraid to google it. The internet is full of forums (I recommend [*StackOverflow*](https://stackoverflow.com/)) with users who had similar issues as you in the past!"

    "- *bool*, short for Boolean value, which is either *True* or *False*\n",
    "- *str*, short for string, which represents plain text (letters, numbers, symbols) inside single (') or double(\") quotes\n",
    "- *list*, a *mutable* (means it can be changed) ordered collection of items (which can be of mixed types) inside square brackets, separated by commas\n",
    "- *tuple*, an *immutable* ordered collection of items (which can be of mixed types) inside regular brackets, separated by commas\n",
    "\n",
    "Other datatypes include:\n",
    "- *dict*, short for dictionary\n",
    "- *set*, similar to *list*, but unordered\n",
    "- *frozenset*, like *set*, but immutable\n",
    "\n",

    "## A quick note on naming conventions\n",
    "In order to improve readability and make code easier to understand for all, there are some naming conventions which should be used throughout your programming.\n",
    "Here are a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try to avoid single-character names (see 3.), especially l (lowercase L), O (uppercase o), and I (uppercase i) as some fonts make these undistinguishable from other characters\n",
    "2. *resultofsum*: do not use words just stuck together, this is programming, not german. Use lowercase naming with underscores (e.g. result_of_sum) or capitalized case (sometimes refered to as CamelCase - because of the bumps) (e.g. resultOfSum) as this makes it easier to read and decypher the name\n",
    "3. *hotdog*: this is a bad name for a number. Strive to use names which give some clue about what a variable contains (e.g. resultOfSum) or what a function does (e.g. multiplyByTwo)\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on naming can be found here:\n",
